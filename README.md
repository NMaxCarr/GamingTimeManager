# GamingTimeManager
This [Playnite](https://playnite.link) extension adds feature to keep track of your gaming time.

## Informations
This basic and simple extension keeps track of how much time your playing video games and can alert you if the limit set is reached.

>[!NOTE]
> The time track works only when game is lunch via Playnite because it uses the `onGameStarted` event.

## Settings
Three settings currently are available:
* Period of time you wish to keep track of your limit. Currently, **Daily** or **Weekly** basis are available.
* Time limit in **minutes** for a given period previously set.
* Activate notification; A Windows alarm will pop once limit is reached. *(Not tested with other OS)*

In any case, a Playnite notification will be showed when a game is closed to inform you about total time played and total time remaining to play.
